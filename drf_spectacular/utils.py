class PolymorphicProxySerializer(Serializer):
    """
    This class is to be used with :func:`@extend_schema <.extend_schema>` to
    signal a request/response might be polymorphic (accepts/returns data
    possibly from different serializers). Usage usually looks like this:

    .. code-block::

        @extend_schema(
            request=PolymorphicProxySerializer(
                component_name='MetaPerson',
                serializers=[
                    LegalPersonSerializer, NaturalPersonSerializer,
                ],
                resource_type_field_name='person_type',
            )
        )
        def create(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
            return Response(...)

    **Beware** that this is not a real serializer and it will raise an AssertionError
    if used in that way. It **cannot** be used in views as ``serializer_class``
    or as field in an actual serializer. It is solely meant for annotation purposes.

    Also make sure that each sub-serializer has a field named after the value of
    ``resource_type_field_name`` (discriminator field). Generated clients will likely
    depend on the existence of this field.

    Setting ``resource_type_field_name`` to ``None`` will remove the discriminator
    altogether. This may be useful in certain situations, but will most likely break
    client generation. Another use-case is explicit control over sub-serializer's ``many``
    attribute. To explicitly control this aspect, you need disable the discriminator with
    ``resource_type_field_name=None`` as well as disable automatic list handling with
    ``many=False``.

    It is **strongly** recommended to pass the ``Serializers`` as **list**,
    and by that let *drf-spectacular* retrieve the field and handle the mapping
    automatically. In special circumstances, the field may not available when
    *drf-spectacular* processes the serializer. In those cases you can explicitly state
    the mapping with ``{'legal': LegalPersonSerializer, ...}``, but it is then your
    responsibility to have a valid mapping.

    It is also permissible to provide a callable with no parameters for ``serializers``,
    such as a lambda that will return an appropriate list or dict when evaluated.
